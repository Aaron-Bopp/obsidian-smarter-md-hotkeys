# Smarter Markdown Hotkeys
This is a demo of the __Smarter Markdown Hotkeys Plugin__. It offers *smarter* hotkeys. 

- When you press a hotkey, markup is applied to the ==whole== word.
	- [ ] __Bullet points or tasks are excluded.__
- *You can even select multiple lines.*
- *Like these two.*

---


Undoing ==markup== works as well.

It ==even== works with ==multiple== cursors! 

That's high ==speed== markup.


---



Links are automatically inserted, too. For example this one: [Obsidian Website](https://obsidian.md/).

The hotkey for `inline code` automatically switches to fenced code, when selecting more than one line:

```shell
foo="That's"
bar="super useful!"
echo "$foo $bar"
```

"And one more thing"

(that's a Steve Jobs quote, by the way)

There are commands for smarter punctuation as well.
